It is known that there are spheres of human life and areas of human activity so complex in nature that they inherently become, on the one hand, absolutely exceptional, and, on the other hand, impossible to seize in any global model: we lack data, we cannot corroborate data extrapolated from the analysis of the various perspectives meant to observe the objects in question but above all things we cannot count on the faithful repetition of the events specific to these spheres and areas. I include in this category the spheres related to both natural and social phenomena, to human thinking, and, finally, to the language activity, deeply embedded in thinking and also seen as central to any instance of communication in our world, namely the world of the living.
